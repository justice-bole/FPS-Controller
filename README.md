# FPS Character Controller for Unity

This is a functional FPS character controller for Unity. You can import this controller into one of your Unity projects and have a ready to use FPS 
character controller straight away! This controller can crawl, crouch, walk, run, sprint, jump, and aim. Each state, like crawling or crouching, 
also has its own collisions and movement speed. Crawling is slower than crouching, but crawling allows you to get lower to the ground and better 
crawl under obstacles, as you might expect. The character's weapon also "sways" when idle and has a sprinting animation. Transitions between states also have
movement smoothing. Many of the settings for the character can be edited right inside Unity's inspector, without any need to open or edit a script directly.

## How To Use:

First, download the .unitypackage file from the link above. Then open a Unity project and find the "Assets" tab at the top of the window view. Click on 
"Assets" -> Import Package -> Custom Package ... Then find and select the .unitypackage you downloaded from the linked page and click continue. Then select all 
the files you wish to import, select "All" if you're unsure, and finally click import. Now in your "Project" folder view select "Prefabs" and add the "Player" 
prefab to your scene hierarchy. Give your player some solid ground to walk on and you're all done, hit play and test out the character.
